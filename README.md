# rare-stem
Final year project

# Setting up the project
Unfortunately I was unable to implement the project folder as an .exe file. It kept freezing when implmenting the JAR file.

- Create simple Boot project url: 
    https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.0.5&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.mousu&artifactId=movies&name=movies&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.mousu.movies&dependencies=lombok,web,data-mongodb,devtools
- JDK
- Install Scene builder Gluon (gluonhq.com) and add it's path to IDEA
    Implement Scenebuilder by File > Settings > Languages and frameworks > JavaFX > Scene Builder in tool folder	
- install the IDEA recommended maven setting, if given, after adding Javafx to the lib project structure.
- The dependencies are included in pom.xml file
- Call the project runtime by adding it to "edit configuration" with Main or MainEXE class @src/main/resources/com/mousuf/rarestem
    (Don't need to add VM Option)
